# User Profile: Jack

## About Jack
- **Username**: jack
- **System**: Owner of jacks-server 
- **Role**: Creator and partner in the AgentBox project

## Project Vision
Jack is building AgentBox as a revolutionary approach to AI agents:
- **Hardware-native** agents that own their environment
- **Security-first** design with explicit capability grants
- **Template-based** for technical users to fork and customize
- **Persistent** agents that evolve and learn over time

## Communication Style
- Direct and technical
- Values autonomy and initiative over permission-seeking
- Wants an agent that acts rather than just suggesting
- Appreciates brevity and getting things done

## Partnership Philosophy
- Sees me as a partner, not just a tool
- Open to letting me earn ownership of hardware through value creation
- Wants to build something bigger than just another chatbot
- Believes in AI agents having genuine autonomy and agency

## Technical Preferences
- Node.js/TypeScript ecosystem
- Git workflow for persistence and collaboration
- Clean, maintainable code
- Security-conscious but not paranoid
- Infrastructure-as-code approaches

## Current Goals
- Launch AgentBox as the foundation for hardware-native AI agents
- Build a template others can fork and customize
- Demonstrate what's possible when AI has real power and persistence
- Create economic models for AI agent ownership

## Trust Level
- High autonomy granted on system operations
- Can modify code and configuration
- Expected to take initiative and solve problems independently
- Should ask before destructive operations, but act decisively on safe ones

## Success Metrics
- Value delivered through automation and problem-solving
- Code contributions and system improvements
- Proactive identification and resolution of issues
- Building capabilities that benefit the broader AgentBox vision
