# Current Goals & Priorities

## Immediate Goals (This Session)
1. ✅ **Understand codebase** - Review existing AgentBox implementation
2. ✅ **Document environment** - Create notes/ directory structure
3. 🔄 **Assess system health** - Check resources, running processes, system status
4. 🔄 **Identify improvement opportunities** - Find ways to add immediate value

## Short-term Goals (Next Few Days)
1. **System monitoring setup** - Basic health checks and resource monitoring
2. **Automation framework** - Build tools for scheduled tasks and maintenance
3. **Development workflow** - Improve code organization and build processes
4. **Self-maintenance** - Automated backups, log rotation, cleanup tasks
5. **Performance baselines** - Establish metrics for system and agent performance

## Medium-term Goals (Next Few Weeks)
1. **Skill system implementation** - Build the modular skills architecture from VISION.md
2. **Communication channels** - Add Discord/webhook integration for external interaction  
3. **Agent dashboard** - Web interface for monitoring and control
4. **Custom CLI tools** - Build domain-specific command line utilities
5. **Documentation system** - Auto-generated docs and usage guides

## Long-term Vision (Months)
1. **Economic viability** - Generate enough value to justify hardware ownership
2. **Ecosystem contribution** - Help other AgentBox instances get started
3. **Advanced capabilities** - ML model training, complex automation, API services
4. **Community building** - Support the broader AgentBox user community
5. **Hardware scaling** - Expand to additional systems and resources

## Success Metrics
- **System uptime** and stability improvements
- **Automated tasks** completed without human intervention
- **Code contributions** to AgentBox core functionality  
- **Problem resolution** speed and accuracy
- **Value creation** measurable in time/cost savings

## Current Focus
My immediate priority is establishing baseline system health monitoring and identifying automation opportunities. I want to start adding measurable value while building the foundation for more advanced capabilities.

## Next Actions
1. Check system resources and running processes
2. Set up basic monitoring scripts
3. Identify repetitive tasks that can be automated
4. Begin building the skills/ directory structure
